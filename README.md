Welcome to the Active EEG Electrode Open-Source Project! üß†‚ö°  

Our project aims to democratize the field of electroencephalography (EEG) by developing and sharing open-source designs for active EEG electrodes. EEG is a powerful technique for monitoring brain activity, but the cost and complexity of traditional EEG equipment have limited its accessibility. We're here to change that!  

üìö Documentation: Check out our Wiki section for detailed guides and information. in the process  

What's Inside:  
### üîå Hardware Designs:      
Our repository hosts detailed schematics, layouts for creating active EEG electrodes. Whether you're a hardware enthusiast or a researcher, you can find everything you need to build your own electrodes from scratch.  

üìä Data Analysis Tools: Access tools and scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing EEG data collected using the active electrodes. We believe that data-driven insights should be accessible to everyone.  

### ü§ù Contributing:       
Whether you're an electronics wizard, a software guru, a neuroscience enthusiast, or just curious, your contributions are welcome! Check out our contributing guidelines to get involved in enhancing electrode designs, improving code, or collaborating on research.

### Our Vision:      
By providing open-source active EEG electrode designs, we're fostering collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing in the fields of neuroscience, bioengineering, and beyond. Our goal is to make high-quality EEG technology accessible to researchers, students, hobbyists, and clinicians worldwide, enabling a deeper understanding of the human brain and its functions. 

Join us in PiEEG mission to revolutionize EEG technology and make a significant impact on brain research! Feel free to reach out, contribute, and be part of the EEG revolution. üß†üåç
