Welcome to the Active EEG Electrode Open-Source Project! 🧠⚡

Our project aims to democratize the field of electroencephalography (EEG) by developing and sharing open-source designs for active EEG electrodes. EEG is a powerful technique for monitoring brain activity, but the cost and complexity of traditional EEG equipment have limited its accessibility. We're here to change that!

📚 Documentation: Check out our Wiki section for detailed guides and information.

What's Inside:
🔌 Hardware Designs: Our repository hosts detailed schematics, layouts, and bill of materials (BOM) for creating active EEG electrodes. Whether you're a hardware enthusiast or a researcher, you can find everything you need to build your own electrodes from scratch.

💻 Firmware: We provide open-source firmware code for the active EEG electrodes, allowing you to customize and optimize the electrode's behavior according to your needs.

🧪 Testing and Validation: We're committed to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our electrodes. Our testing protocols, validation results, and data analysis scripts are available for transparency and collaboration.

📊 Data Analysis Tools: Access tools and scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing EEG data collected using the active electrodes. We believe that data-driven insights should be accessible to everyone.

🤝 Contributing: Whether you're an electronics wizard, a software guru, a neuroscience enthusiast, or just curious, your contributions are welcome! Check out our contributing guidelines to get involved in enhancing electrode designs, improving code, or collaborating on research.

Our Vision:
By providing open-source active EEG electrode designs, we're fostering collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing in the fields of neuroscience, bioengineering, and beyond. Our goal is to make high-quality EEG technology accessible to researchers, students, hobbyists, and clinicians worldwide, enabling a deeper understanding of the human brain and its functions.

Join us in our mission to revolutionize EEG technology and make a significant impact on brain research! Feel free to reach out, contribute, and be part of the EEG revolution. 🧠🌍
